# Consciousness-detection-
a real-time driver alertness monitoring system using the YOLOv5 deep learning framework for detecting states of consciousness ("awake" vs. "drowsy"). Implemented live video feed analysis with high detection accuracy and minimal latency, leveraging computer vision techniques. The system was designed for safety-critical applications.
